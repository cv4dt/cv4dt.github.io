[Guangming Wang](https://guangmingw.github.io/) is a Postdoctoral Research Associate of the Department of Engineering at the University of Cambridge.

I am an Associate Editor (AE) for IEEE RAL, ICRA2024, 2025, 2026, and IROS2024, 2025. I was awarded the DAAD AI and Robotics fellow. 

Most of my co-mentored undergraduates have gone to UC Berkeley, Princeton, HKU, Columbia, Gatech, UCSD, UCLA, TUM, SJTU and so on. Some of them got full scholarships for direct PhD students. Welcome to contact me to come to the University of Cambridge for a visiting PhD student or remote collaboration!

My recent research interest lies at the intersection of 3D computer vision and robotics. I am particularly interested in robot world model and robot munipulation learning, using advancing methods, like NeRF, 3DGS, LLM, diffusion model, physical AI, etc.
