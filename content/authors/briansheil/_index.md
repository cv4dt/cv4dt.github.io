Dr Brian Sheil studied Civil Engineering for his undergraduate degree at the National University of Ireland, Galway (NUIG). He studied the behaviour of deep foundation systems for his PhD (also at NUIG), which involved a period as a Visiting Scholar at the University of California, Berkeley.

In 2014, Brian joined the University of Oxford as a postdoctoral researcher in experimental geotechnics focused on industry-funded research projects and was subsequently promoted to departmental lecturer in geotechnical engineering in January 2017. In 2018, he was awarded a Royal Academy of Engineering Research Fellow at Oxford and a Junior Research Fellowship at St Catherine’s College (Oxford). In January 2021, Brian was appointed to the position of Honorary Research Senior Lecturer at NUIG and in 2022, he was awarded the title of Associate Professor at the University of Oxford. He took up his current position as the Laing O'Rourke Associate Professor in Construction Engineering in September 2022. He recently received the ‘Young Researcher Award 2022’ from the Civil Engineering Research Association of Ireland.

His research involves the development of new science and technology to optimise the efficiency, safety and sustainability of underground construction, and he teaches construction engineering in the Engineering department.
