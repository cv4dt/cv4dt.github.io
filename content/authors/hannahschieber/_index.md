I am a PhD student under the supervision of Prof Daniel Roth at the Technical University Munich (TUM). My research focuses on radiance field, digital replicas, 6D pose estimation, and guidance in 3D using extended reality (XR), with an emphasis on novel view synthesis and the enhancement of classic 3D reconstruction through computer vision. Specifically, I investigate how editable 3D Gaussian Splatting can serve as a flexible and efficient scene representation. This includes enabling interactive editing of reconstructed environments, integrating semantic information, and supporting novel-view synthesis directly within XR systems. By enhancing classic 3D reconstruction pipelines with modern vision techniques, my research aims to create more immersive, accurate, and adaptable digital replicas for XR.
Moreover, I guide as a tutor several courses like: Advanced Topics in 3D Computer Vision or Modern Computer Vision Methods
In winter term 2024/2025, I hold the seminar Computer Vision in the Operating Room @ TUM.
