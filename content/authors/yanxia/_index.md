My research interests focus on understanding 3D scenes, such as localization, detection and tracking, shape completion, and segmentation. I am looking for highly self-motivated collaborators and talented and enthusiastic students who are interested in autonomous driving and robotics. Feel free to get in touch with me via email. Please find more details about my work on my personal [webpage](https://yan-xia.github.io/)!
