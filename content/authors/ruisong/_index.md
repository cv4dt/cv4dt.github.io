I am a research fellow at UCLA Mobility Lab, working with Prof. Jiaqi Ma. I obtained my Ph.D. degree from Technical University of Munich (TUM) with highest distinction (summa cum laude), under the supervision of Prof. Alois Knoll and Prof. Andreas Festag, with invaluable mentorship from Prof. Holger Caesar. I was a senior researcher at Fraunhofer IVI, and led/co-led to 4 research projects with a combined budget over €15 million. Before that, I was a technical product owner for autonomous driving at ZF R&D Center and IPG Automotive.

My research interests include deep learning, computer vision, cooperative intelligence and their applications in autonomous driving, transportation or robotics.

I am open to collaboration opportunities in VLM/VLA, 3D and 4D Gaussian Splatting, closed-loop simulation in autonomous driving and robotics, and would be glad to explore potential synergies.
