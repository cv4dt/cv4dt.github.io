I am a Postdoctoral Research Associate of the Department of Engineering at the University of Cambridge.

Jingâ€™s MSc research explored the seismic Performance of skew bridges considering the effects of pounding. During this time, developed a new interest in deep learning applications in bridge engineering and maintenance. His DPhil (co-supervised by Dr. Brian Sheil; primary supervisor was Professor Sinan Acikgoz) will be exploring the application of deep learning techniques to assist bridge geometry generation and displacement and strain monitoring.
