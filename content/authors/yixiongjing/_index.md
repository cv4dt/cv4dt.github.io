I am a Postdoctoral Research Associate of the Department of Engineering at the University of Cambridge.

My research lies at the intersection of 3D computer vision and robotics. I am particularly interested in advancing 3D reconstruction methods such as NeRF, 3DGS, and extending 3DGS for physical reasoning, i.e., enabling LLMs to understand and reason about complex 3D environments.

I also explore generative models including diffusion models, score-based approaches, flow-matching methods, and Schrodinger Bridge with the aim of integrating them into robotic manipulation systems. Ultimately, my goal is to build generalizable robots that can adapt flexibly to diverse and dynamic scenes.
