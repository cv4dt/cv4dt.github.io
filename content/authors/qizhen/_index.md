I am a PhD Candidate at University of Oxford. 

My research focuses on the intersection of computer vision and physical reasoning. I am dedicated to developing generative models that can produce physically plausible samples, addressing the challenge of real-world data scarcity. My approach integrates reinforcement learning with novel generative model architectures. Fundamentally, the long-term goal is to generate high-quality data for scientific discovery and robotics applications.
